LocalStorage keys are created but data is not properly persisted across page refreshes. SUCCESS RATE: Dashboard functionality 100%, Data persistence 0% (0/5 tests passed).

    message: "🎯 FINAL DATA PERSISTENCE VERIFICATION COMPLETED! Performed comprehensive testing of the data persistence fixes that were implemented. CRITICAL FINDINGS: ❌ ALL 3 PERSISTENCE FEATURES ARE FAILING (0/3 working). ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The persistence system has a fundamental architectural flaw in the useEffect dependency management and callback function handling. DETAILED ANALYSIS: 1) Console logs show data IS being loaded correctly: 'Loading saved wallet config: {wallet_address: LTC1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4}' and 'Loading saved mining controls config: {threads: 6, intensity: 0.8}', 2) However, immediately after loading, the data is overwritten: 'Saving wallet config: {wallet_address: }' and 'Saving mining controls config: {threads: 4, intensity: 1}', 3) This indicates the useEffect hooks are triggering save operations that overwrite the loaded data with default/empty values. TECHNICAL ISSUE: The useCallback functions and useEffect dependency arrays are causing infinite re-render cycles where loaded data is immediately replaced by initial state values. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to fix the useEffect dependency arrays and ensure loaded data takes precedence over default state initialization. The localStorage mechanism works correctly - the issue is in the React state management logic."

However, after thorough analysis of the backend code (/app/backend/server.py), I found that CUSTOM COIN MANAGEMENT FEATURES HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. ❌ MISSING FEATURES: No custom coin CRUD endpoints (POST /api/coins/custom, GET /api/coins/custom, PUT /api/coins/custom/{id}, DELETE /api/coins/custom/{id}), No custom coin validation endpoint, No custom coin database storage, No custom scrypt parameter validation, No export/import functionality. ✅ EXISTING FEATURES: Only GET /api/coins/presets endpoint exists (returns hardcoded LTC, DOGE, FTC presets). 📊 BACKEND TESTING STATUS: All 15 backend tasks in test_result.md are marked as working:true and needs_retesting:false, meaning no backend testing is required per my instructions. 🔍 CONCLUSION: The custom coin management feature requested for testing has not been implemented in the backend. The main agent needs to implement these features before they can be tested. Current backend only supports predefined coin presets, not custom coin creation/management."
