<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transitioned a Python-based cryptocurrency mining application to a Node.js ecosystem, addressing critical Python dependency and installation issues. The initial MVP was built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, focusing on core mining, UI, and system monitoring. Key decisions included implementing data persistence using , introducing role-based UI sections, and handling complex installation scenarios. The major pivot to Node.js (Express, Socket.io, Mongoose) resolved persistent build challenges and improved performance. Post-conversion, a robust custom coin management feature was added, allowing users to define new Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies. Following this, the codebase was significantly streamlined by removing all Python-related components. The latest task involves meticulously resolving ESLint warnings to enhance code quality and maintainability, ensuring a clean and functional application.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining program with real-time monitoring (hashrate, shares, blocks, CPU, memory) and an AI self-learning block hash prediction system. This evolved to include configurable multi-coin mining (Litecoin, Dogecoin), AI-driven hash pattern prediction and coin switching, support for solo/pool mining, manual controls (threads, CPU/memory, limits, AI override), and wallet integration. Subsequent requests added manual pool/RPC address entry, automatic CPU core detection, and a major UI overhaul into role-based sections (Mining Performance, Miner Setup, System Stats). Automated Python component verification and a complete build test were also requested. Due to persistent Python installation issues, the user explicitly requested a full backend conversion to Node.js. Post-conversion, a feature to add other user-defined Scrypt coins was requested, followed by a request to clean up unused files. The most recent request is to fix reported ESLint warnings for code quality.

<code_architecture>
The application, originally Python-based, has been fully converted to Node.js for its backend, while retaining its React frontend. The codebase resides in .



**Key files and their importance/changes:**

*   : The new core of the backend. It's an Express application handling all API routes (e.g., , , ), WebSocket communication, and integrates the mining, AI, and system monitoring modules. Recently updated to include CRUD operations for custom coins and remote access endpoints.
*   : A new Mongoose model defining the schema for custom cryptocurrency configurations, enabling persistence of user-added coin details.
*   : The central React component. Manages global application state, orchestrates component rendering, and defines  wrappers for stable function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Updated to pass new custom coin and persistence states.
*   : React component for configuring wallet addresses, custom mining pools, and RPC settings. Modified to persist its state to  and include  dependency array fixes.
*   : React component for mining settings like thread count and performance profiles. Updated to persist its state to  and include  dependency array fixes ().
*   : React component for selecting the cryptocurrency to mine. Modified to integrate and display both built-in and newly added custom coins, with its state persisted to .
*   : A newly created React component providing the UI for users to add, view, edit, and delete their custom Scrypt-based cryptocurrency configurations. It now imports .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in addressing ESLint warnings reported by the user to improve code quality and maintainability of the React frontend. This task was initiated after the successful full Node.js conversion, implementation of custom coin management, and comprehensive file cleanup.

The specific warnings being addressed are:
1.   in . This was fixed by including  in the dependency array.
2.   in . The  function was wrapped in  and added to the dependency array. The necessary  import was also added.
3.   in . The  function was wrapped in  and added to the dependency array.
4.   in . This is currently being worked on.
5.   and  in . These are also pending fixes.

The current state is that fixes for , , and  have been successfully applied, and the engineer is now proceeding to fix . The goal is to eliminate all reported linting issues.
