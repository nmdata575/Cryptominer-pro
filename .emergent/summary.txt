The AI engineer successfully migrated a Python/FastAPI/MongoDB cryptocurrency miner to a Node.js/Express/MongoDB stack with a React frontend. Key initial issues included MongoDB connectivity, supervisor conflicts causing backend crashes, and frontend rendering errors due to unhandled undefined states for system metrics. These were resolved by proper MongoDB startup, consistent supervisor control, and robust optional chaining in React components. Subsequent work addressed installation script inaccuracies and critical Webpack 5 polyfill issues preventing frontend builds. The CPU frequency display, initially showing an erroneous 2 MHz, was meticulously fixed across both backend API (for ARM architecture compatibility) and frontend rendering. The current task involves debugging a Failed to start mining 500 error, which has been narrowed down to a potential issue within the backend's mining engine, possibly related to configuration validation or the mining start logic itself.

<product_requirements>
The product is a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining application with real-time monitoring (hashrate, shares, blocks, CPU, memory). It supports multi-coin mining (Litecoin, Dogecoin), AI-driven hash prediction, solo/pool mining, and manual controls (threads, limits). Key features include manual pool/RPC entry, automatic CPU core detection, and a role-based UI. A major pivot from Python to Node.js for the backend was requested due to installation issues. Post-conversion, other user-defined Scrypt coins were added. Recent work focused on resolving ESLint warnings, enhancing CPU detection for containerized environments, fixing rate-limiting (though not explicitly detailed in trajectory execution), and ensuring stable WebSocket (Socket.io) with HTTP polling fallback. The current debugging aims to resolve backend  errors on mining start.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was debugging a  reported by the frontend when attempting to start mining. The error message  and  indicated a backend issue.

The debugging steps taken were:
1.  Checking the backend supervisor status, confirming it was running.
2.  Attempting to directly  the backend's mining start endpoint ().
3.  Initial  requests revealed validation errors from the backend (, ), suggesting the API endpoint itself might be working but expecting specific parameters.
4.  The AI then started inspecting the frontend's  file, specifically the  function, to understand what  (the payload sent to the backend) contains.
5.  Concurrently, the AI examined the backend's  for the  route definition and then the  file, particularly its  method, suspecting that the 500 error might arise after initial validation passes, or if the  method itself encounters an unhandled exception.

The current state is that the  method in  has been reviewed, and it appears logically sound. The next step in the trajectory involves continuing to trace what happens *after* validation within the  method of the .
