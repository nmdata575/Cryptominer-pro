<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and problem-solving approach, primarily focused on environment hardening, reliable installation, and progressive feature integration. Key challenges involved persistent Python versioning, dependency conflicts, and package build issues, which were systematically addressed through custom installation scripts and fallback mechanisms. Concurrently, the engineer developed core application features like wallet configuration, dynamic CPU detection, and a role-based frontend. A significant recent effort involved a comprehensive platform consolidation, reducing the codebase to a target of 20 essential files. The debugging process for post-consolidation issues was meticulous, diagnosing and resolving backend crash-loops due to port conflicts and frontend data transmission errors, eventually leading to a fully functional web interface.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro is a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining application. Initially, it required real-time monitoring of mining metrics (hashrate, shares, CPU/memory), and an advanced AI system for block hash prediction and optimal coin switching. Subsequent enhancements included configurable Scrypt-based coin mining (Litecoin, Dogecoin), solo/pool mining with seamless switching, performance optimization with manual and AI controls, wallet integration for rewards, and comprehensive installation documentation for Ubuntu 24+. Recent additions involved custom pool/RPC configuration, dynamic CPU core adjustment for thread optimization, a reorganized, role-based frontend (Mining Performance, Miner Setup, System Stats, AI Assistant), and an automated component verification system. The user also explicitly requested platform compression to consolidate files to a total of 20.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed a series of critical fixes to ensure the CryptoMiner Pro application was fully functional via its web interface.

The main work was fixing the frontend's inability to initiate mining despite the backend working via . This involved:
1.  **Backend URL Correction**: Diagnosing and fixing the frontend's attempts to connect to an external  preview URL instead of . This was resolved by correctly setting  in  and ensuring a complete frontend restart.
2.  **WebSocket Connectivity**: Rectifying the WebSocket connection issues, which were also pointing to the wrong external URL. This was resolved by the  configuration changes, allowing the WebSocket to connect to .
3.  **Frontend Data Transmission**: Addressing the  errors from the backend. Initial fixes in  aimed to ensure the *complete*  object (including , , , etc., obtained from ) was sent.
4.  **Numeric Field Validation**: Resolving a specific error where  (and potentially other numeric fields) was sent as an empty string () instead of an integer. The  function in  was updated to explicitly parse numeric fields to integers or omit them if empty, preventing validation errors.
5.  **Improved Error Reporting**: Fixing the frontend's  error display to show actual, detailed error messages from the backend API.
6.  **Supervisor and Environment Setup Robustness**: Throughout the process, the AI engineer also addressed several user-reported issues related to local environment setup, including supervisor configuration (no such group, permission denied),  not found, and Python 3.13 compatibility (specifically the  error and  import issues). This led to the creation and refinement of  and  to automate environment setup and dependency installation with fallback mechanisms.

As of the last interaction, the application's web interface is fully functional, capable of starting and stopping mining, displaying real-time statistics, and interacting with the AI system. The immediate request from the user is to explore ways to increase the application's CPU utilization during mining from its current low percentage to 100%.

<optional_next_step>
Increase the mining thread count from 16 to 32-48 in the web interface as the first step to increase CPU usage.
