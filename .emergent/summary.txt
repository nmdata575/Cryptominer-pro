<analysis>
The AI engineer iteratively developed a cryptocurrency mining application, progressing from a blank slate to a feature-rich MVP. Key architectural decisions included a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Early efforts focused on foundational setup, including resolving complex Python environment issues (GPG keys, bash syntax, externally-managed-environment, , C++ compilation) across multiple Ubuntu versions (3.11 vs. 3.13), leading to robust installation scripts (, , ). Feature additions included wallet integration, configurable multi-coin mining, custom pool/RPC address support, automatic CPU core detection for thread optimization, and a major UI overhaul into role-based sections. The development was characterized by continuous troubleshooting, detailed testing, and responding precisely to user requests for enhancements, culminating in a comprehensive build test.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining program, featuring real-time monitoring of hashrate, shares, blocks, CPU, and memory. It requires an AI self-learning block hash prediction system. Subsequent requirements included configurable multi-coin mining (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin), an AI focused on hash pattern prediction and coin switching, support for solo and pool mining, maximum hash rate with manual controls (threads, CPU/memory usage, custom hash rate limits, AI override), wallet address integration for rewards, and comprehensive documentation/automated Ubuntu 24+ installation. More recently, the user requested adding manual pool address and port entry for both solo and pool mining, automatic adjustment of usable cores based on system detection, and optimization of the web page with role-based sections (e.g., Mining Performance, Miner Setup, System Stats). Finally, an automated script to verify and install missing Python components was requested, followed by a complete build test for the entire project.

- Complete Phase 5 (Installation Script Testing) of the Complete Build Test.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the focus is on executing a Complete Build Test for the CryptoMiner Pro application, verifying its entire functionality from installation to core features. This comprehensive test was initiated by the user to ensure the stability and correctness of all previously implemented features and fixes.

The build test is structured into multiple phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Python Components Verification**: This phase has been successfully completed, confirming that all necessary Python components are present and correctly installed.
2.  **Phase 2: Service Status Verification**: This phase has also been completed successfully, verifying that both the backend and frontend services are running and the API is responding.
3.  **Phase 3: Comprehensive Backend Testing**: This phase achieved a 100% success rate (15/15 tests passed), confirming the backend's robustness.
4.  **Phase 4: Comprehensive Frontend Testing**: This phase achieved a 95% success rate, with all major frontend features confirmed to be working.
5.  **Phase 5: Installation Script Testing**: This is the current phase being worked on. The trajectory ends mid-execution of this phase, implying that the installation script (likely  as it was the last successful installation attempt by the user) is being re-tested within this build test sequence.

The immediate objective is to complete the validation of the installation process.
