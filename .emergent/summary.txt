The AI engineer's work involved an iterative, phased approach to building a complex cryptocurrency mining application. Initial efforts focused on understanding an empty workspace, leading to a detailed architectural plan for a React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack application. Key decisions refined through user interaction included configurable multi-coin mining, a comprehensive AI prediction system (hash patterns, difficulty, coin switching), and maximizing hash rate with manual controls. The development process systematically addressed environment setup, core feature implementation (wallet integration), and robust installation scripting. Significant challenges debugged included GPG key issues for PPAs, bash/dash syntax incompatibilities in shell scripts, and Python's externally-managed-environment error, demonstrating a strong problem-solving and environment hardening capability.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a fully functional web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining program. This program must incorporate the complete Scrypt algorithm and provide real-time web-based monitoring of:
*   Hashrate
*   Accepted Shares
*   Rejected Shares
*   Blocks Found
*   CPU Load
*   Memory Usage

Additionally, an advanced AI self-learning block hash prediction system is required, fully interfaced with the webpages. The system needs to be a seamless, perfectly integrated crypto mining program, leveraging internet information for optimal functionality.

Through subsequent interactions, the following requirements were clarified and incorporated:
*   **Mining Target**: Configurable for different Scrypt-based coins (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin).
*   **AI Focus**: A comprehensive AI system emphasizing hash pattern prediction for efficiency, network difficulty forecasting for timing, and optimal coin switching recommendations.
*   **Mining Mode**: Support for both solo mining capabilities and pool mining integration with seamless switching.
*   **Performance Priority**: Maximum hash rate performance, complemented by manually controlled performance (user-adjustable thread counts, CPU/memory usage, custom hash rate limits, fine-grained tuning, manual AI override).
*   **Wallet Integration**: Ability to enter a wallet address for mining rewards.
*   **Documentation**: Comprehensive step-by-step instructions, README, quick reference, and automated installation scripts for Ubuntu 24+.

The immediate pending task is to fix the Permission denied error when  attempts to create the virtual environment at .

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on resolving a critical installation issue for the CryptoMiner Pro application. The problem is a Permission denied error when the  script attempts to create the Python virtual environment at . This error occurred immediately after implementing a fix for the externally-managed-environment issue, which involved ensuring Python 3.11+ environments use a virtual environment for package installation.

The root cause identified is that the virtual environment creation command () is executed *before* the  directory has been fully set up with the correct permissions (likely  context).

The work done so far to address the Python environment issues includes:
1.  **Modified **: To detect Python 3.11+ and automatically create , then install  into it. The supervisor configuration was also updated to use the virtual environment's Python executable.
2.  **Created **: A utility script to analyze the Python environment (version, external management status, recommendations).
3.  **Created **: A script to repair existing CryptoMiner Pro installations by creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and updating supervisor configurations.

The very latest message indicates the AI engineer has diagnosed the Permission denied error and plans to reorder the installation steps in  to ensure the project directory exists and has appropriate permissions before the virtual environment creation is attempted.

Modify the  script to ensure the  directory is created and has correct permissions *before* attempting to create the virtual environment within it.
