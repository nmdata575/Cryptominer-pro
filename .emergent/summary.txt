<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully guided the CryptoMiner Pro application from an initial MVP state to a robust, feature-rich mining platform. The development trajectory focused heavily on environment hardening and installation reliability, iteratively addressing complex Python versioning, dependency management, and build tool issues across multiple attempts. Concurrently, new product features were introduced, including advanced wallet configuration, dynamic CPU core detection for thread optimization, and a reorganized, role-based frontend dashboard. The approach was iterative, incorporating user feedback, performing extensive testing (backend, frontend, installation), and leveraging troubleshooting agents when encountering persistent issues. The trajectory highlights a strong problem-solving capability, particularly in debugging intricate installation failures.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining program.
Initial requirements included:
*   Real-time monitoring: Hashrate, Accepted/Rejected Shares, Blocks Found, CPU Load, Memory Usage.
*   Advanced AI self-learning block hash prediction system, integrated with webpages.
*   Seamless, integrated crypto mining leveraging internet information.

Subsequent clarifications and additions:
*   **Mining Target**: Configurable for Scrypt-based coins (Litecoin, Dogecoin).
*   **AI Focus**: Hash pattern prediction, network difficulty forecasting, optimal coin switching.
*   **Mining Mode**: Solo and pool mining with seamless switching.
*   **Performance Priority**: Maximize hash rate, manual controls (thread counts, CPU/memory usage, custom limits, AI override).
*   **Wallet Integration**: Ability to enter a wallet address for mining rewards.
*   **Documentation**: Comprehensive instructions and automated Ubuntu 24+ installation scripts.
*   **Custom Pool/RPC**: Manually enter pool address/port for solo/pool mining, including RPC credentials.
*   **Dynamic Core Adjustment**: Automatically adjust usable cores based on system's CPU.
*   **Web Page Optimization**: Reorganize frontend into role-based sections (Mining Performance, Miner Setup, System Stats, AI Assistant).
*   **Automated Component Verification**: A script to verify and install missing Python backend components.

3.  **Comprehensive Backend Testing**:  was invoked and achieved a 100% success rate (15/15 tests passed).
4.  **Comprehensive Frontend Testing**:  was invoked and achieved a 95% success rate, confirming all major frontend features (including the newly added custom pool/RPC and dynamic core detection) were working.
5.  **Installation Script Testing**: The  script was run and completed successfully, verifying the robustness of the installation process after numerous fixes for Python versioning, dependency conflicts, and compilation errors.

The application currently has a new role-based dashboard, supports custom pool/RPC addresses and ports, dynamically adjusts mining threads based on CPU core detection, and has a robust installation system capable of handling Python 3.11 and 3.13 environments, including a fallback mechanism for dependencies.
